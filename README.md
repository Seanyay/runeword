# Diablo 2 Runeword Calculator
Use the runeword calculator to plug in which runes you have, so you can see what you can create!

## How to use
- Left-click a rune to increment the count by 1
- Right-click a rune to decrement the count by 1
- You can use the text inputs to set the counts directly
- As you add/remove runes, the runewords you can make will update on the right side. A runeword will be visible if you have at least (1) rune from that runeword.
- By default, the "Have Runes" sort method will bubble to the top the runewords that you own the most runes from, secondarily sorted by runeword CLVL.
